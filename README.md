# Canadian Computing Competition Practice

This repository contains my Python solutions to various Senior level problems from the CCC. This repository will be updated periodically (Jan 2021 - Feb 2021) as I practice for the CCC. The problems were sourced and verified using DMOJ. The repository also contains parts of my study plan and books I used to learn advanced programming concepts like graph theory and dynamic programming ahead of the contest.
